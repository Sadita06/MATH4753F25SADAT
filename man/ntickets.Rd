\title{Calculate Number of Tickets for Airline Overbooking}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Number of seats available on the flight.}

\item{gamma}{Probability of overbooking.}

\item{p}{Probability that a passenger shows up.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
  \item{nd}{Optimal number of tickets using discrete distribution}
  \item{nc}{Optimal number of tickets using normal approximation}
  \item{N}{Number of seats}
  \item{p}{Probability of showing up}
  \item{gamma}{Overbooking probability}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the optimal number of tickets to sell on an airplane using discrete and continuous approaches.
}
\details{
The function finds n such that pbinom(N, n, p) = 1 - gamma for the discrete case,
and pnorm(N, n*p, sqrt(n*p*(1-p))) = 1 - gamma for the continuous case.
It also creates a plot showing the objective functions for both approaches.
